## 📝 FULL SCRIPT (Under 3 minutes)

### SCENE 1: THE PROBLEM (0:00 - 0:25)
**[Avatar appears with confident energy]**

"Imagine you're building a marketplace for developer tools. You spend weeks coding the frontend, the search, the filters, the detail pages. 

Now imagine you need to build ANOTHER marketplace for a different audience. What do you do? Copy-paste everything? Maintain two codebases? Fix bugs in two places?

There has to be a better way."

**[Pause for impact]**

---

### SCENE 2: THE SOLUTION - THE BIG REVEAL (0:25 - 0:50)
**[Avatar gestures with excitement]**

"Introducing Haunted Agents Marketplace - where ONE skeleton creates INFINITE marketplaces.

Here's the game-changer: We built a reusable skeleton - one codebase that powers unlimited marketplace applications. 

Want a marketplace for React developers? Just change the config file.
Want one for DevOps engineers? Change the config file.
Want one for data scientists? You guessed it - change the config file.

ZERO code duplication. ZERO maintenance nightmare. INFINITE scalability."

**[Confident smile]**

---

### SCENE 3: THE MAGIC - HOW IT WORKS (0:50 - 1:30)
**[Avatar explains with clarity]**

"Let me show you the magic. We have THREE layers:

LAYER ONE: The Skeleton
One React frontend. One CLI tool. One set of components. Written once, used everywhere.

LAYER TWO: Configuration
Each marketplace is just JSON files. Agents, branding, categories, images. No code required.

LAYER THREE: Agent Bundles
These are the secret sauce. Each bundle transforms Kiro IDE into a specialist. 

A bundle includes:
- MCP servers for tool integration
- Steering files with best practices
- Hooks for automation
- Spec templates for documentation

Install with ONE command: 'kiro-agent install react-supabase-expert'

And boom - your Kiro IDE becomes a React and Supabase expert."

**[Pause]**

---

### SCENE 4: THE PROOF - LIVE DEMO (1:30 - 2:10)
**[Avatar gestures to demonstrate]**

"We built TWO completely different marketplaces to prove it works:

Marketplace ONE: Kiro Agents Marketplace
For Kiro IDE developers. Three bundles: React plus Supabase Expert, API Documentation Wizard, and Test-Driven Development Coach.

Marketplace TWO: DevOps Automation Hub  
For DevOps engineers. Three bundles: CI/CD Pipeline Template, Kubernetes Monitor, and Terraform Helper.

Same code. Different configs. Completely different experiences.

The CLI works with both. The search works with both. The installation works with both.

One skeleton. Infinite possibilities."

**[Confident nod]**

---

### SCENE 5: THE IMPACT - WHY THIS MATTERS (2:10 - 2:40)
**[Avatar speaks with passion]**

"Here's why this is a turning point for Kiro:

BEFORE: Developers waste 2-3 days configuring their environment, searching for best practices, setting up automations.

AFTER: One command. Five minutes. Everything configured. Best practices loaded. Automations running.

For companies: Save two thousand dollars per developer. Ensure 100% consistency across teams.

For the ecosystem: Anyone can create a marketplace. Anyone can publish bundles. Anyone can monetize their expertise.

This isn't just a marketplace. It's a PLATFORM. It's an ECOSYSTEM. It's the future of developer tooling distribution."

**[Powerful pause]**

---

### SCENE 6: THE CALL TO ACTION (2:40 - 3:00)
**[Avatar speaks directly to camera with energy]**

"We built this entire system - the skeleton, two marketplaces, six complete bundles, and a full-featured CLI - to show what's possible.

The code is open source. The demos are live. The CLI is ready to publish.

This is just the beginning. Imagine marketplaces for every programming language, every framework, every tool, every industry.

One skeleton. Infinite possibilities. 

That's the power of Haunted Agents Marketplace.

Built with Kiro IDE. Built for the future."

**[Confident smile and fade out]**
