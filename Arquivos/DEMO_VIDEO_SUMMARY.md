## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't have video editing experience?**
A: Use simple tools like iMovie (Mac) or OpenShot (free). The recording guide includes beginner-friendly options. You can also do a single-take recording with minimal editing.

**Q: Can I use screen recording software I already have?**
A: Yes! Any screen recording software works. The guide provides recommendations, but use what you're comfortable with.

**Q: What if my video is slightly over 3 minutes?**
A: Edit it down. Cut pauses, speed up slow sections (1.1-1.2x), or remove less critical content. The 3-minute limit is strict.

**Q: Do I need a custom thumbnail?**
A: Not required, but highly recommended. It makes your video look more professional and stand out. Use Canva for easy thumbnail creation.

**Q: What if I make a mistake while recording?**
A: That's why we recommend segment recording! Record each section separately, do multiple takes, and pick the best ones.

**Q: Can I add background music?**
A: Yes, but keep it subtle (10-20% volume) and use royalty-free music. YouTube Audio Library is a good free source.

**Q: What if YouTube processing takes too long?**
A: HD quality can take 15-30 minutes. If it's stuck for over an hour, try re-uploading. Upload well before the hackathon deadline!
